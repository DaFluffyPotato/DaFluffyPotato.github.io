<br><h2>Who is DaFluffyPotato?</h2>
<p>
DaFluffyPotato(me) is a game developer who mostly works in Python and is known to make almost <i>anything</i> with <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> even if it doesn't make sense. Most notably, I made an <a href="dat/img/irc_client.png">IRC client</a> with Pygame and made the questionable decision of multithreading it. I also almost exclusively make my games with pixel art.<br><br>I have made many games, the more recent of which(although almost exclusively game jam games) are on <a href="https://cmlsc.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>.

<h2>But <i>Who</i> is DaFluffyPotato?</h2>
<p>DaFluffyPotato is actually one of my various usernames. I originally used CMLSC as my username for game development stuff, but now I go with DaFluffyPotato because it's more recognizable. Sometimes you might see me as LarryMcMuffin though.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>My Origins</h2>
<p>I've been programming since 2013. Because I'm very resistant to change, I've been using Python and Pygame this whole time. I entered my first <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> in April of 2016(LD 35) while sick. I haven't missed a single Ludum Dare since.</p><br><br>
