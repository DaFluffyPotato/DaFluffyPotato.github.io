<br><h2>Who is DaFluffyPotato?</h2>
<p>
DaFluffyPotato(me) is a game developer who mostly works in Python and is known to make almost <i>anything</i> with <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> even if it doesn't make sense. Most notably, I made an <a href="dat/img/irc_client.png">IRC client</a> with Pygame and made the questionable decision of multithreading it. I also almost exclusively make my games with pixel art.<br><br>I have made many games, the more recent of which(although almost exclusively game jam games) are on <a href="https://cmlsc.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>But <i>Who</i> is DaFluffyPotato?</h2>
<p>DaFluffyPotato is actually one of my various usernames. I originally used CMLSC as my username for game development stuff, but now I go with DaFluffyPotato because it's more recognizable. Sometimes you might see me as LarryMcMuffin though.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>My Origins</h2>
<p>I've been programming since 2013. Because I'm very resistant to change, I've been using Python and Pygame this whole time. I entered my first <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> in April of 2016(LD 35) while sick. I haven't missed a single Ludum Dare since.</p><br><br>
<h2>The FAQ That Nobody Ever Asks</h2><br>
<h3>What is my favorite game?</h3>
<p>My favorite game is Pokemon Red Rescue Team.</p>
<br>
<h3>Where am I from?</h3>
<p>Murica if you couldn't guess. In most places, I'll just say the Milky Way.</p>
<br>
<h3>What do I use?</h3>
<p>I use Python and Pygame for code, <b>MS Paint</b> for art, <a href="http://www.boscaceoil.net/">Bosca Ceoil</a> or <a href="http://beepbox.co">Beepbox.co</a> for music, and a microphone or <a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">SFXR</a> for sound effects.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The FAQ That I Have Been Asked</h2><br>
<h3>Where does the name DaFluffyPotato come from?</h3>
<p>It doesn't actually mean anything. I just came up with it out of nowhere and I liked the sound of it. I used to go by CMLSC(and still do sometimes), but nobody could remember the letters, so I needed a new name anyway.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why do your games look like FEZ?</h3>
<p>I have been inspired by FEZ's pixel art in the past, but most of my inspiration comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/Managore/">Daniel Linssen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/x_rxi/">rxi</a>. I also pick up other techniques from just looking at pixel art or figuring it out on my own.</p>
<br>
<h3>How did you learn to make games?</h3>
<p>When it comes to Python and pixel art, foley, and voice acting, I'm 100% self taught(which is probably why I put most of my code in one file and don't use OOP that much). In music, which is my weak area as of now, I took 8 years of piano lessons.</p>
